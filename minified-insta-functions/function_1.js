// This code doesn't perform any specific functionality on its own. 
// Instead, it sets up structures and stubs that may be used by other scripts or parts of the application. 
// It's common to see such setup code in complex web applications, especially those that use modular JavaScript
// and asynchronous module loading. These stubs and functions can be populated and utilized by other scripts to 
// manage dependencies and load modules as needed.
